                I attend Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona. I
                am earning a degree in applied computer science and plan to
                graduate in Spring of 2018. I have so far taken courses in
                object-oriented programming, web development, computer
                architecture, operating systems, and user interfaces. After
                graduation, I hope to get a job working as part of a software
                development team.

                I have been programming since I was in high school, but I did
                not become very interested in it until I started taking programming
                courses in college. Since then I have learned many different
                languages such as Python, Java, C, MIPS Assembly, PHP, HTML,
                CSS and JavaScript. I have started to lend my skills to help
                programming for the Neptune project, which is a standard being
                developed at Boston University for conducting microfluidic
                experiments. In the Spring of 2017 I wrote a web application
                for generating instruction sets based on a user uploaded file
                specifying hardware abilities. It was my first software written
                for use outside of academia, and was done entierly in HTML, CSS
                and JavaScript. A simple JavaScript game I have made for this
                website can be viewed <a href="dice.html">here</a>.

                I started taking piano lessons when I was in grade school. I
                enjoyed it and quickly started pushing myself to learn more
                songs outside of my lessons. In middle school I expanded my
                instrument range to bass guitar, and later in high school to
                also include electric guitar and drums. In college I started
                playing in various music groups, and during the Summers I would
                tour across the country playing shows.
